          In contrast, you can only use Flexbox to create one-dimensional
          layouts.

        <td>
          The main difference is that you can use CSS Grid to create
          two-dimensional layouts.

        <td>Flexbox provides a simpler syntax for controlling layout.</td>
        <td>
          Grids reduce the need for complicated media queries and provide the
          added advantage of 2D layouts over flexbox.

          While flexbox is supported by most major browsers, it's still newer
          than the traditional box model.
        </td>
        <td>
          Grids are still very new and therefore only partially supported by
          major browsers.
